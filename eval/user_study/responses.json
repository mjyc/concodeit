The video tutorial demonstrating how to wait for an action to be completed was very helpful.",

Also, there wasn't the necessary puzzle blocks for some of the tasks described which left me to have some unfinished statements that I couldn't make it complete because there weren't the necessary blocks. Hopefully you guys can add those next time so that others can complete it well.",

However, I have never ever programmed robots. So I am not at all familiar with block-based programming.\n\nI watched the tutorial on youtube, but the video quality was very poor, so I could not distinguish the text in the video. So it was not that much helpful\n\nI felt a frustrated in the  main task - not because I did not know well how to program the robot, but because I felt like a needed a prior training before to better understand the system.\n I was mostly using trial-error but that felt frustrating and could not complete the task after spending close to 1 hour -- I wanted to really know how the system works before completing the program. For example, a prior basic training of how to detect a button pressed.\nI would include some basic examples prior jumping into the main programming task.\n\nI strongly feel that I could solve correctly the program withing a few hours, but I think it would be more efficient of actually knowing a bit more about his kind of robot programming, and not just try things out without really knowing about the platform.",

There's some strange interaction with the rest of the robot code.\n\nOther than that, my biggest issue with the study was that the interface was incredibly frustrating to use. It was too small, and couldn't be resized.\n\nCallbacks are easy enough to work with but lead to some unnecessary design patterns. (Also, in this example, I was very tempted to only wait for the longer of two robot actions to complete since it's guaranteed to finish second.)",

    "Any other comments about the study?": "This program felt very similar to MIT's scratch program with one major plus--it had a much more simplified UI.  That being said, I found it very difficult to figure out what to do and how the loops worked.  As someone who does know how to code, I quickly found myself feeling frustrated not being able to find where or how to make functions call other functions.  Especially because I know I could do this easily on my own local coding environment. As a big sister, trying desperately to get her younger sisters interested in computer science I wouldn't quite recommend this to a novice but maybe an intermediate learner because the built in support isn't good for debugging or finding why your program isn't behaving as you want. I had a really hard time debugging mine (and wasn't able to successfully do so within 50 minutes so I called it quits).  Something I would like to see would be improved functionalities that would maybe highlight the block of code your robot is executing so you can see how the functions are jumping between each other?  All in all, I appreciate the efforts and think you are all doing wonderful, important work!",

Most of my actual progress was made through trial and error and it took me around 50 minutes, and I have a good deal of programming experience; I don't see how a beginner is going to be able to navigate this system first try. An more in-depth tutorial on how to do basic things (I spent 10 minutes figuring out how to display a button and still kinda fudged it since I couldn't figure out how to display it without using a list lol) would also be nice.",

After a while, the button wouldn't disappear, so the else statement wouldn't happen and the timer couldn't run out. Also, even when I typed in and lastSpeechDetected = \"start\", the robot still wouldn't recognize that command, but in the beginning it did recognize it though only lowercase input. Anyhow, these problems seem to occur after the implementation of a more complex occurrence, such as an if statement.",

    "Any other comments about the study?": "I didn't know how to display the text of the display block based on a certain condition rather than after a certain time because I couldn't take out the for __ sec part. There might have been something wrong with how I did my repeat while block,s but it didn't seem to stop displaying the text after I entered START. I wasn't really sure how the wait for all worked with displaying the buttons (when is it \"done\" displaying a button - I was guessing after it was pressed?\"); I guess I did it wrong because it never left the wait for all even after I pressed one of the buttons? Sometimes there was a stack trace error when I connected the display buttons block directly to the display block. I apologize if I missed something obvious, but those parts made it confusing for me and I wasn't able to really test it to get a good solution because of those misunderstandings.",
