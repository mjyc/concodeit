I have a solid programming experience with Java/kotlin, and some with C and C++. However, I have never ever programmed robots. So I am not at all familiar with block-based programming.

I watched the tutorial on youtube, but the video quality was very poor, so I could not distinguish the text in the video. So it was not that much helpful

I felt a frustrated in the  main task - not because I did not know well how to program the robot, but because I felt like a needed a prior training before to better understand the system.
 I was mostly using trial-error but that felt frustrating and could not complete the task after spending close to 1 hour -- I wanted to really know how the system works before completing the program. For example, a prior basic training of how to detect a button pressed.
I would include some basic examples prior jumping into the main programming task.

I strongly feel that I could solve correctly the program withing a few hours, but I think it would be more efficient of actually knowing a bit more about his kind of robot programming, and not just try things out without really knowing about the platform.
