# ConCodeIt!

A visual programming for authoring interactive programs.

ConCodeIt stands for "concurrent" [CodeIt](https://github.com/hcrlab/code_it) and aims to make creating reactive, interactive robot programs easy for novice programmers.
ConCodeIt! is built with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) and is integrated with [cycle-robot-drivers](https://github.com/mjyc/cycle-robot-drivers). Currently, the system can be used to program a [tablet face robot](https://github.com/mjyc/tablet-robot-face), an idealized social robot.

## Getting Started

There are three versions of ConCodeIt. To run the the first version, do

```
cd waitfor  # or callback or async
