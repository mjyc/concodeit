# ConCodeIt

A Blockly wrapper for robotics programs. For now, it is integrated with [cycle-robot-drivers](https://github.com/mjyc/cycle-robot-drivers) but we hope to integrate with other robot frameworks such as [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org).

ConCodeIt stands for "concurrent" [CodeIt](https://github.com/hcrlab/code_it) and is built to help novice programmers with creating reactive, interactive robot programs easy for novice users.

# Getting started

There are three versions of ConCodeIt. To run the the first version, do

```
cd condition1-waitforblocks  # or condition2-callback or condition2-asyncmethods
npm install
npm run
```
