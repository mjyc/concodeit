# Title

## ConCodeIt: End-User Programming Tool for Social Robots



# NABC

* Need: programming robots require
* Approach: We introduce waitForAll and waitForOne Blockly blocks; we apply ideas from web programming (+ CS education research?)
* Benefits: Using waitForAll and waitForOne allows programmers to stay in easy to understand, imperative programming paradigm
* Competition: FSM, FRP, Petri nets, other Blockly implementations that enable async calls

1. the web community also does this: https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9



# Contributions

* A big problem in EU social robot programming
* A study across three popular programming paradigms



# Evaluation

## Independent variable: interface condition

1. Callback
2. Async
3. waitForAll/waitForOne


## Dependent variables

* ease of use
  * subjective
  * objective: error analysis
* expressivity
